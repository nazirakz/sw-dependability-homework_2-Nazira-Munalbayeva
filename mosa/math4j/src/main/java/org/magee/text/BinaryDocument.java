/**

 * The <code>BinaryDocument</code> class controls the character input into

 * <P>

 * 

 * The use of this class is implemented by calling setDocument on a text

 * component. When a string is entered into a text area by a keyboard event

 * (typing or pasting) or by other means (TextComponent.setText()) it is first

 * examined to contain only ones and zeroes. If it passes this test then the

 * string is inserted for the view by the user.
